Thanks for using the Shoutcast Stats Version 2,

I have added many things that Version 2 was set too. The main one the online picture.

Just edit the config_radio.php and then upload it to your server along with the radio_stat.php

After that you have yourself a PHP Script.

Enjoy!

To use this script in any pages that you have its very easy.

Use this code, and put it where you want the stats to show on any page.

<?php include "radio_stats.php"; ?>

Goodluck!
